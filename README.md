  Quickly switch macOS' <b>PowerChime</b>
</p>

![Preview](preview.png)

<p align="center">
	As far as I can guess, this sound appears only on MacBooks with <b>USB-C charging</b>, so starting with 2015 MacBook.

</h2>

	<p align="center">
		I don't expect you using it often, so the script doesn't install on your Mac, it just runs and that's all
	</p>

```powershell
curl -sL git.io/powerchime | sh
```

### Reasons
<details>
  <summary>Annoyance</summary>
  <br>
  The sound of the charging cable being connected is unnecessary and might even be annoying, because you already see battery status right in the Menu Bar.
  
  <br><br>
  > The weird thing is that macOS lets you easily switch, for example, [the startup sound](#switching-the-startup-sound), but not PowerChime.

  <summary><sub>To remove PowerChime even with the lid closed...</sub></summary>
<blockquote>
  <br>
  <ol>
    <li>Disable <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Integrity_Protection">SIP</a></li>
    <li>Remove the `/System/Library/CoreServices/PowerChime.app/Contents/Resources/connect_power.aif` file</li>
  </ol>
  <p>This may or may not work. Better Google it.</p>
